# Notes on naming.

I prefer to name variable and method with what the effect is going to be.

I the first version of the cache busting I named it "skip_cache". Good enough for that time.

However, the actually statement from Nginx is "BYPASS". And due to the application I am busting cache on is Wordpress...

So "skip_cache" becomes "wp_bypass_cache".

Make sense?
