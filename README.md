# nginx-configurations

Configuration files for Nginx and Wordpress with cache and cache busting using Nginx.

A configuration for an Angular 1.xx main site and a subdirectory with an Angular 7.xx dev site.

Also, configurations for Let's Encrypt.

The Wordpress configuration allows use of SFTP for uploading and updating directly into Wordpress. It also allows use of the Nginx Helper plugin.

I should also note that these configurations are secure and score A+ at [SSL Labs Test](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/index.html).

The OS is Debian 9.6, Nginx 1.15.7, php 7.0.30, and Wordpress latest.

YMMV.
